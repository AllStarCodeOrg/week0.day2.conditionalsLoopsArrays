# week0.day2.conditionalsLoopsArrays

## Instructions
1. Create a Repo on GitHub named "conditionalsLoopsArrays" - [GitHub Lecture (ses slide 22+)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dbCztEBiZovdkDYO3aN-K8UC7pfVzK1E5PE43j1E4f4/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Remember to initialize it with a README.md
2. In command line, navigate to your “Documents” Folder:
   - Clone the repo to your computer using `git clone {url}`
3. Inside of this repo, create a file called “conditionalsLoopsArrays.js”
   - Copy (`Ctrl+C`) and paste (`Ctrl+V`) [this code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week0.day2.conditionalsLoopsArrays/master/conditionalsLoopsArrays.js) into the file
4. Follow the instructions in the comments
5. Test your code frequently by running the `node conditionalsLoopsArrays.js` command
   - *Hint: Long filename, huh? If you’re not already doing so, use the auto-complete functionality - try hitting “Tab” after typing the first letter or two of the filename; the console will try to find the best match based on what you’ve already typed.*
     - *If there are multiple matches you can rapid tap “Tab” twice to see what they are*
4. Remember to add, commit, and push your changes!
5. Look over these worksheets to help fill in any gaps. We’ll be reviewing these on Monday!
   - *NOTE: this is NOT homework. From the past two years, students have REQUESTED worksheets, so I have provided them. Use them at your discretion!*

## Extra Credit
- Convert your `while` loop into a [`do/while` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while). What’s the advantage of using a `do/while` loop?
